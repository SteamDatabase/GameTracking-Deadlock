regex_error(error_backref): The expression contained an invalid back reference.
regex_error(error_badbrace): The expression contained an invalid range in a { expression }.
regex_error(error_badrepeat): One of *?+{ was not preceded by a valid regular expression.
regex_error(error_brace): The expression contained mismatched { and }.
regex_error(error_brack): The expression contained mismatched [ and ].
regex_error(error_collate): The expression contained an invalid collating element name.
regex_error(error_complexity): The complexity of an attempted match against a regular expression exceeded a pre-set level.
regex_error(error_ctype): The expression contained an invalid character class name.
regex_error(error_escape): The expression contained an invalid escaped character, or a trailing escape.
regex_error(error_paren): The expression contained mismatched ( and ).
regex_error(error_parse)
regex_error(error_range): The expression contained an invalid character range, such as [b-a] in most encodings.
regex_error(error_space): There was insufficient memory to convert the expression into a finite state machine.
regex_error(error_stack): There was insufficient memory to determine whether the regular expression could match the specified character sequence.
