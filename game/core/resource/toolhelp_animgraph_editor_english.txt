</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<h3>State Machine</h3>

<h4>Unlocked (default)</h4>

<p>
While unlocked, the end effector isn't touched.  The lock is read to see if it ever crosses the threshold (0.9 at the time of this writing) and records the lock position in world space, and switches to the locked state.
</p>

<h4>Locked</h4>
<p>
When locked, the end effector target's position is set to the location specified by the lock that was initiated.  As the lock fades (it's influence heads towards zero), the lock is blended with the position/orientation that would've resulted if unlocked, trying to blend us back to normal.  Upon reaching the release threshold (less than 0.1), we revert to the unlocked state.
</p>
