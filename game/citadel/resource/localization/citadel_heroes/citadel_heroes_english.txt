Content with being a Sheriff in a small town, Holliday enjoyed a career where the only time she had to use her gun was when trick shooting at the county fair...then the murders started.\n\nGrisly and inhumane; the bodies were found with their ribcages ripped open... their innards picked apart as if by birds.  Holliday tracked down the killer, a travelling folk musician that the media dubbed \"The Troubadour\", but when she confronted him he exploded into a murder of crows and flew away.\n\nThat was 6 months ago, and while the murders in central Illinois have stopped, Holliday's investigation has not.  She believes that The Troubadour is travelling to New York, and when she finds him she's going to kill that evil son of a bitch."

Abrams hasn't figured where the thing came from; but seeing as his home has been broken into, his office tossed on 3 different occasions, and his car firebombed he has a vested interest in figuring out what the hell is going on."

Together they would work in the iron yard during the day, and listen to jazz at night. It was a predictable, if not comforting routine.  But now, Bebop's creator has fallen ill and while Miss Shelly wouldn't approve of the activities that Bebop does at night to pay for her medicine, what she doesn't know can't hurt her."
		"hero_wrecker_lore"				"When the Maelstrom  first hit New York, it didn’t just usher in a new age of mysticism to the world… it changed geopolitics.  From CIA employed seers identifying threats decades before they rise to power to occult pacts made in smoky backrooms;  countless wars and atrocities have been prevented that would otherwise have shaped history.  But that doesn’t mean there is no war… just that war has changed.\n\nParanormal Military Companies have risen to prominence.  These groups, using a combination of extra-planar creatures and various blood magics; have found ways to circumvent the guardrails established by the nation’s watchdog oracles, allowing them to function as proxies for nations seeking to wage war.\n\nWrecker is one such soldier.\n\nEmployed by Eldritch Tactical Solutions (a subsidiary of Fairfax Industries), Wrecker is an elite soldier of fortune with a reputation for doing dirty work that other PMC’s don’t have the stomach for."

Put it on display at pop-up museums, so that they can show the world that no one is out of Paradox’s reach.\n\nShrouded in mystery, each member of Paradox dons a mask and takes on the organization's name.  They are everywhere.  They are nowhere.  And if they want something, they are inevitable."

So when a rift in space and time opened up in central park he was first on the scene to investigate – and while he expected such a majestic sight to be life changing, he was thinking more in a metaphorical way as opposed to having his body atomized and reduced to a tiny dying star.\n\nBut while his body is gone, his spirit and lust for knowledge lives on.  A tenured professor at Columbia College, Dynamo looks to learn more about his condition while maintaining his class load, after all: he has future minds to inspire."
		"hero_forge_lore"				"Maggie McGinnis always had a knack for building things.  At 4 she was using Lincoln Logs to recreate architectural marvels.  At 10 she built and rewired a custom light fixture for her parent's anniversary.  At 15 she designed a machine that refined the souls of the dead...that last one got a little more attention than the Lincoln Logs.\n\nNow the head of Fairfax Industries Military R&D department, McGinnis spends her time in the machine shop, not in a lab.  She's not interested in theory, to her science is magic you can touch."
		"hero_ghost_lore"				"Once, Lady Jeanne Geist was the toast of the town.  But as time passed and her beauty faded she found herself further and further from her glory days in High Society until finally she was nothing more than a frail woman in a nursing home, telling stories of a glorious past.  And that’s when Oathkeeper revealed himself.  A powerful spirit from another plane, Oathkeeper offered her a path to reclaim her past glories… he could restore her youth; all she had to do was drain the essence of the living to sustain herself. \n\nGeist was torn.  Obviously murder was ghoulish business, and undoubtedly Oathkeeper was not an entity that could be trusted… but still, the thought of having a second chance of reliving her youth was too good to pass up.  And so she concocted a plan: after making a pact with Oathkeeper she would bind and ward him, limiting his influence and pull over her.  Oathkeeper would still get fed; but on her terms, not his.\n\nHowever, as years have turned to decades; the strength of the Ward has weakened, and Oathkeeper hungers more than he ever has in the past… "
